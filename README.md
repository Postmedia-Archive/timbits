# Timbits
Widget framework based on Express and CoffeeScript

## Introduction

Timbits is an attempt to build an easy and reusable widget framework on top of Express.  These widgets are meant to render independent HTML snippets based on REST based JSON/XML data sources and brought together on a page via ESI (Edge Side Includes)

It's primarily meant to serve internal purposes as Postmedia Network Inc, however it is being open sourced under the MIT License.  Others may find some use for what we are doing, and still others may be able to help turn this into a more generic and useful solution by contributing and/or correcting our ignorant ways.

Be kind.  We're coming from years of .NET experience and some Ruby on Rails.  This is our first foray into Node.js development and we're still figuring things out.  Constructive criticism is encouraged.  If you see something odd and think to yourself "WTF?" then by all means, let us know.

## Usage

Yea, we're not even close to having useful documentation yet.  Stay tuned.

## Outstanding Issues

Way too much at this time.  On the short list (and mostly in progress):

* Integrated testing framework
* Integrated benchmarks
* Command line server with ability to automatically restart
* Documentation
* Refactor and expand data retrieval, including caching, conditional GETs, XML support
* Support for alternate server configurations
* More examples
* Deployment and monitoring process
